/* THE DATA STRUCTURES */

/* The first type definition defines the type for a single entry in the
 * table.  The second defines the type for the table as a whole.
 */

        char * label;           /* label name */

/* THE FUNCTIONS */

void tableInit  (LabelTable * table);

         *       are no label entries in it.

         *      label entries.  If the new size is smaller than the
         *      old size, the table is truncated after the first
         *      newSize entries.
         * Returns 1 if everything went OK; 0 if memory allocation error
         *      or table doesn't exist.

         *      unchanged; otherwise a new entry has been added to the
         *      table with the specified label name and instruction address
         *      (memory location) and the table has been resized if necessary.
         * Returns 1 if no fatal errors occurred; 0 if memory allocation error
         *      or table doesn't exist.
         */
