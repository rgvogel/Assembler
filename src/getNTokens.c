/*
 * This file contains the getNTokens function, which reads the specified
 * number of tokens from a string.  This function takes three parameters,
 * a string containing tokens, the number of tokens that should be in
 * the string, and an array large enough to take N strings.  The
 * function does not modify N, but it does modify both the original
 * string (inserting null bytes after each token) and the array of results.
 *
 * A token is defined as a string of characters, not including
 * whitespace, commas, parentheses, or a colon.  For example, the
 * following string contains 5 tokens, which are "loop", "add", "$t0",
 * "$t1", and "$t2".
 *      loop:   add $t0, $t1, $t2
 *
 * If the string contains exactly N tokens, getNTokens returns 1 and
 * fills the given array with pointers to N strings, one for each token.
 * If the string contains fewer than N tokens, getNTokens returns 0 and
 * puts a pointer to an error message in the first array element
 * ("Instruction contains fewer tokens than expected.").  If the string
 * contains more than N tokens, getNTokens again returns 0 and puts a
 * pointer to a different error message in the first array element
 * ("Instruction contains more tokens than expected.").
 *
 * The getNTokens function uses the getToken function.
 *
 * See getNTokens.h for more specific information about how getNTokens
 * behaves and for an example.

 * getNTokens -- read N tokens from instructionBuffer, putting the
 *               resulting tokens in results
 * Parameters:  instructionBuffer -- a string containing tokens
 *              N -- the expected number of tokens in instructionBuffer
 *              results -- an array of strings containing the tokens
 * Precondition:
 *              instructionBuffer is a valid pointer to a string &&
 *              N >= 1 &&
 *              results is a valid pointer to an array containing space
 *                  for at least N string pointers
 * Postcondition:
 *              If instructionBuffer contains N tokens, results is
 *              filled with strings, each containing one of those
 *              tokens and getNTokens returns 1.  If
 *              instructionBuffer contains fewer or more than N tokens,
 *              getNTokens returns 0 and puts a pointer to an
 *              appropriate error message in results[0].
